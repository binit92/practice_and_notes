    "**Why Asynchronous Programming**\n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous programming allows you to write concurrent code that runs in a single thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Concurrency \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are reading a novel while painting. Even if it seems like you are doing both tasks at the same time, what you are doing is switching between the two tasks; while you wait for the paint to dry you are reading your novel, but while you are painting you pause your reading. This is called concurrency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Single thread allows you to decide where the scheduler will switch from one task to another, which means that sharing data between tasks is safer and easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Minimum Memory Usage \n",
    "\n",
    "Every time a new thread is created, some memory is used to allow context switching. If we use async programming, this is not a problem since the code runs in a single thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s learn about the components of an asynchronous code in the next lesson.\n",

    "\n",
    "To write asynchronous code in python, import the library using `import asyncio`.\n",

    "#### Components \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Event Loop\n",

    "#### Future\n",

    "\n",

However, that function does not necessarily get executed right away. Instead, there is usually a mechanism (called the “scheduler”) which is responsible for the future execution of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with asynchronous programming is that a program may end before any asynchronous function starts. A common solution for this is for asynchronous functions to return “futures” or “promises”. These are objects that represent the state of execution of an async function. Finally, asynchronous programming frameworks typically have mechanisms to block or wait for those async functions to end based on those “future” objects."
