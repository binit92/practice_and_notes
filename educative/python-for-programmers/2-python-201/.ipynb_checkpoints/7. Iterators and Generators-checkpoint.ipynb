    "### Iterators \n",
    "\n",
    "An iterator is an object that will allow you to iterate over a container. the iterator in Python is implemeted via two ditinct methods: \\_\\_iter\\_\\_ and \\_\\_next\\_\\_.  The `__iter__` method is required for your contaienr to provide iteration support. It will return the iterator object itself. But if you wnat to create an iterator object, then you will need to define `__next__` as well, which will return the next item in the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To make things extra clear:\n",
    "+ **iterable** - an object that has the `__iter__` method defined\n",
    "+ **iterator** - an object that has both `__iter__` and `__next__` defined where `__iter__` will return the iterator object and `__next__` will return the next element in the iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with most magic methods(the methods with double-underscores), you should not call `__iter__` or `__next__` directly. Instead you can use a **for** loop or list comprehension and Python will call the methods for you automatically. There are cases when you may need to call them, but you can do so with Python's built-ins: **iter** and **next**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we move on, let's take a look at Sequences. Python 3 has several sequence types such as list,tuple and range. The list is an iterable, but not an iterator because it does not implement `__next__`. This can be easily seen in following example:"
