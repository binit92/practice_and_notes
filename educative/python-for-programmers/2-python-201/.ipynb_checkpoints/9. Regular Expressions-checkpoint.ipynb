    "### Introduction to Regular expression\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expression are basically a tiny language all their own that you can use inside of Python and many other programming languages. You will often hear regular expressions referred to as \"regex\",\"regexp\" or just \"RE\". Some languages, such as Perl and Ruby, actually support regular expression syntax directly in the language itself. Python only supports them via a library that you need to import.  The primary use for regular expressions is matching strings. You create the string matching rules using a regular expression and then you apply it to a string to see if there are any matches. \n",
    "\n",
    "The regular expression \"language\" is actually pretty small, so you won't be able to use it for all your string matching needs. Besides that, while there are some tasks that you can use a regular expression for, it may end up so complicated that it becomes difficult to debug. In cases like that, you should just use Python. It should be noted that Python is an excellent language for text parsing in its own right and can be used for anything you do in a regular expressiom. However, it may take a lot more code to do so and be slower than the regular expression because regular expression are compiled down and excuted in C.\n"

    "### The Matching Characters\n",
    "\n",
    "When you want to match a character in a string, in most cases you can just use the character or that substring. So if we wanted to match \"dog\", then we would use the letters **dog**. Of course, there are some characters that are reserved for regular expressions. These are known as _metacharacters_. The following is a complete list of the metacharacters that Python's regular expression implementation supports:\n",
    "\n",
    "> . ^ $ * + ? { } [ ] | ( )\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's spend a few moments looking at how some of these work. One of the most common pairs of metacharacters you will encounter ar ethe square braches: [ and ]. There are used for creating a \"chracter class\", which is a set of chracters that you would like to match on. You may list the chracters individually like: **[xyz]**. This will match any of the characters listed between the braces. You can also use a dash to express a range of charcters to match against: **[a-g]**. In this example, we would match against any of the letters a through g.\n",
    "\n",
    "To actually do a search though, we would need to add a beginning charcter to look for and an ending character. To make this easier, we can use the asterisk which allows repetitions. Instead of matching *,the* will tell the regular expression that the previous character may be matched zero or more times. \n",
    "\n",
    "It always helps to see a simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "> a[b-f]*f\n",
    "\n",
    "This regular expression pattern means that we are going to look for the letter _a_, zero or more letters from our class, [b-f] and it needs to end with an _f_. Let's try using this expression in Python:"

Then because it has a character class with an asterisl on the end, it will actually read in the rest of the string to see if it macthes. If it doesn't, them it will backtrack one character at a time attempting to find a match. \n",
    "\n",
    "All this magic happens when we all the **re** module's **search** function. If we don't find a match, then **None** is returned. Otherwise, we will get a **Match** object, which you can see above. To actually see what the match looks like, you need to call the **group** method.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's another repeating metacharacter which is similar to \\*. It is +, which will match one or more times. There is a subtle difference from \\* which mataches **zero** or more times. The + requires at least one occurence of the character it is looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last two repeating metacharacters work a bit differently. There is the question mark, ?, which will match either once or zero times. It sort of marks the character before it as optional. A simple example would be \"co-?op. This would match both \"coop\" and \"co-op\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The final repeated metacharacter is {a,b} where a and b are decimal integers. What this means is that there must be at least a repetitions and at most b. You might want to try out something like this:\n",

    "> xb{1,4}z\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a pretty silly example, but what it says is that we will match things like **xbzm xbbzm xbbbz** and **xbbbbz** but not **xz** because it doesn't have a \"b\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The next metacharacter that we'll learn about is ^. This character will allow us to match the characters that are not losted inside our class. In other words, it will complement our class. This will only work if we actually put the ^ inside our class. If it's outside the class, then we will be attempting to actually match against ^. A good example would be something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "> [^a]\n",
    "\n",
